# Weather.io

Weather.io is a simple,
user-friendly application that fetches
and displays real-time weather data for any city
using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [Open Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com).

## How to start

After you installed pnpm (you can look here at the [installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation)), you can run the following command:
`pnpm install` <br>
This will install all the dependencies for the project.
<br> <br>
After that you can run the following command, to look at the current state (with your own changes) of the project:
`pnpm dev`
